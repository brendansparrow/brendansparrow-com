Hi, I'm Brendan, a Lincolnshire-based, freelance web designer and developer. I've enjoyed success across a broad range of disciplines including illustration, layout design, art direction, front-end development, interaction design and brand consulting. Working across both design and code, I embrace my position as a creative generalist to make any ideas a reality.

At the heart of my craft is a keen focus on delivering outstanding results for my clients. My mission is to use technology to make peopleâ€™s lives better in small, subtle ways each day, and to bring more curious minds to the open web.
