Hi, I'm Brendan Sparrow, a hybrid designer/developer, based in Lincolnshire.

At the heart of my work is a keen focus on delivering outstanding results for my clients. I'm a generalist. Coding is the greatest tool I've ever come across, though, I first learnt to design before I learnt to code.

My vision is to produce work that pushes traditional boundaries by exploring and embracing new ideas and technologies. My mission is to use technology to enhance peopleâ€™s lives in small and subtle ways. I strive to make information universally available and affordable. My aim is to help bring clarity to the world, welcoming curious minds to the infinite pastures of the digital future. I do this by helping others do the best work they can and by crafting solutions to their problems that inspire curiosity while standing the test of time.

Outside of my work, I'm a retired gamer, avid film buff and occasional artist.
