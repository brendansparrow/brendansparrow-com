# Services

My practice evolved around a need to define the strategic, UX, creative design and technology functions of modern business. I embrace agile development and the principles of user-centred design to deliver robust, responsive and performant digital solutions.

I develop a profound understanding of your customers through research & analytics and then tailor digital solutions to help drive ROI across web, mobile & social media.

## Content Strategy

To put it simply, I improve the effectiveness and penetration of your brand online and can provide an actionable road-map for your business’ long-term digital future. My strategic framework is built on extensive market research, detailed customer analysis, and occasionally, intuition. Together we can identify key opportunities for your business and develop strategies that better engage your customers. Whether you are looking to improve leads, increase conversion or leverage social media engagement, I can create a digital strategy that inspires real change.

## User Experience (UX) Design

I have an obsession with user-focused design and a compulsive need to simplify complex information flows to make things easier for the average reader. I start by researching to identifying key opportunities for your business and develop strategies that better engage your customers. Taking an agile approach to rapid prototyping and testing, I employ cutting-edge visual design to create intuitive, beautiful, digital experiences.

## Web development and API integration

I have been successfully delivering enterprise website projects for clients for over half a decade. My deep technical capabilities ensure all of my digital projects are built to deliver performance, simplicity, reliability and scalability. Throughout my development process I use version control and continuous integration to combine disciplined engineering practices with flexibility and adaptability.

## Social Media &amp; Marketing Strategy

I work with you to develop a social media strategy that defines rules for engagement, tone of voice and social measurement tools. I identify optimal social channels for your brand to better engage users and participate in organic conversations. I deliver ideas and branded content which can be distributed across owned and paid content channels, amplifying the ROI for your marketing spend.

## Indie Publishing

I love helping people make things. Whether it’s helping a friend choose a blogging framework or advising a budding author on where to publish online, I really am all about helping people.
