My practice revolves around a need to define the strategic, creative and technological functions of modern business. I embrace agile development and user-centred design to deliver the most robust, responsive &amp; performant digital solutions for my clients.

### Research

I start every project by building a profound understanding of the specific requirements of that industry. This applies not just to the company and its competitors, but also to the people using the website or product. You'll benefit from direct research &amp; analysis to help define key problems and craft digital solutions that work for everyone.


### User Experience (UX) Design

I have an obsession with user-focused design and a compulsive need to simplify complex information flows to make things easier for the average reader. Together, we will identify core opportunities for your business, develop strategies to support your users and apply an agile approach to research, information architecture, rapid prototyping and testing to ensure the user experience is the best it can be.


### Content Strategy

To put it simply, I can improve the effectiveness and penetration of your brand online by providing an actionable road-map for your business’ long-term digital future. With this model in place, we can develop features that better engage your customers. Whether you hope to boost site traffic, increase conversion or leverage social media, I can create a digital strategy that inspires real change.


### Interface Design and Interaction

Working on the visual side of a product is where I really start to excel. Interface design goes beyond how the content looks. Visual design is about how to make the content communicate most effectively. I am able to dig into your specific company requirements and imbue the final product with the right tone and personality for your brand. With 10 years experience in the design industry, I can create the best designs for beautiful, engaging, intuitive experiences.

### Web development and API integration

In addition to my design and strategic work, I've been enthusiastically delivering commercial web projects for clients for over half a decade. My deep technical knowledge and methodical approach to development means that all products are built to deliver performance, reliability and scalability. Throughout the process I leverage version control, design systems and the latest build tools to ensure the highest quality.

### Performance Audits

An often overlooked area of web development is the performance of the final product. Speedy sites make money (and benefit the environment too), which is why I also specialise in delivering blazing-fast, streamlined, experiences for your users.


### Indie Publishing

Finally, I love helping people make things. Whether it’s helping a friend choose a blogging framework or advising a budding author on where to publish online, I really am all about supporting the underdog.

## Client List

All work listed below was undertaken between 2014 and 2019 while working for Sheffield-based agencies [EdHQ](https://www.edhq.co.uk) and [Aspire Creative](https://www.aspirecreative.co.uk), where I undertook both creative and development roles as a Developer/Designer.
