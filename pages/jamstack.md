For a long while, websites were built using dynamic Content Management Systems (CMS) to manage content. However, the resulting code was often bloated and slow to run. A new approach has since emerged to help savvy developers build much more efficient products.

The JAMstack is not about specific technologies. It’s a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience.

## What is JAMstack?

The thing that JAMstack sites have in common is that they don’t depend on a web server. This is what the JAM in JAMstack actually means:

### JavaScript

Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled by JavaScript, running entirely on the client. This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla JavaScript.

### APIs

All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into reusable APIs, accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services.

### Markup

Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time, usually using a site generator for content sites, or a build tool for web apps.

## When is your site not built with the JAMstack?

Any project that relies on a tight coupling between client and server is not built with the JAMstack. This includes sites built with a server-side CMS like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, or Squarespace, and server-run web apps that rely on another backend language to build views on the server at runtime.

## What does this mean for my business?

You can forget about the technical aspects of JAMstack. The details don't matter, what matters is that your site is built to be as robust and performant as possible. The sites I build are designed to get out of your way, and make content publishing easier. If you would like to learn more about the options available to you, please [get in touch](/contact) today.
