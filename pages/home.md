# Designer, developer, strategist and educator: digital products with style and purpose.

Hi, Iâ€™m Brendan, I spend my time swimming the troubled waters of the internet and teaching my clients how to fish.

## Services

I work with clients, large and small, to deliver business value at minimal cost. I thrive on getting the most out of technology, while still keeping a firm hold on the human principles that drive us to do better.

My practice evolved around a need to define the strategic, UX, creative design and technology functions of modern business. I embrace agile development and the principles of user-centred design to deliver robust, responsive and performant digital solutions.

I develop a profound understanding of your customers through research & analytics and then tailor digital solutions to help drive ROI across web, mobile & social media.


## Projects

### MachineWorks

I was responsible for the design and development of the website for this software development firm based in Sheffield, UK, from initial designs straight through to production code.
