For me, 2019 was a year of recovery and rediscovery. Early in the year, I decided to take some time off work after experiencing burnout from my previous job. I used the time to explore all kinds of new interests (and old ones) and to complete a number of side projects. In May, I then turned 30! Throughout the year, I rekindled my love for languages and storytelling, completed a screenwriting course with the aim to start writing film scripts and expanded my programming knowledge via Python, C# and TypeScript.

- 3 side projects completed
- 162 CodePens created
- 42 repositories created and 480 contributions made on GitHub
