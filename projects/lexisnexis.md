While at Aspire, I spent 2 years honing and maintaining the frontend interface for the UK branch of this international legal software provider and their Enterprise Solutions department. This also included developing a series of landing pages for their range of over 30 products, using a static site generator to speed up our publishing workflow.

LexisNexis were a huge client. I found the process of working with them frustrating, if I'm honest. Communication was always relayed through multiple channels, there was in-fighting between different departments and in general, the scope of the project.

What they really needed was an effeective design system, though their close ties with Oracle really limited the scope of waht could be done.

I was responsible for building a number of landing pages for them including a series of product releases.
