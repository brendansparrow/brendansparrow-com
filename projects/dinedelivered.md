The highlight of my 4-year stint at Sheffield agency, [Aspire Creative](https://www.aspirecreative.co.uk), was building this award-winning catering experience for Dine. The project involved planning, designing and coding the user flows and design system for an interactive menu-building app, tailored specifically for large events organisers. It won [Best Use of Technology](https://www.thecaterer.com/articles/532082/cateys-2018-best-use-of-technology-award-dine-delivered) at the 2018 Catey Awards.
