There are a million CSS frameworks out there and many of them look pretty much identical. That's why I was happy to contribute towards a framework that has a bit more personality. NES.css by [B.C. Rikko](https://twitter.com/bc_rikko) is a front-end CSS library inspired by the 8-bit style of the NES console. Great for any retro game projects or Nintendo fans.
