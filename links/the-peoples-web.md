I love this article by Anil Dash. In it, he espouses the value of using community-led independent websites over the platforms created by the usual tech giants.

> Every day, millions of people rely on independent websites that are mostly created by regular people, weren't designed as mobile apps, connect deeply to culture, and aren't run by the giant tech companies. These are a vision of not just what the web once was, but what it can be again.
