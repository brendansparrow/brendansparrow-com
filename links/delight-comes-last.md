In this short essay Matthew Ström introduces an idea I hadn't encountered before: the concept of a hierarchy of user needs (based on Maslow's hierarchy). The core needs are: functionality, efficiency and delight, with delight coming last.

> [Your] product has to satisfy the needs at each level before moving on to the next. A product can’t be efficient if it isn’t functional. A product can’t be delightful if it isn’t efficient and functional.
